# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts



In the project directory, you can run:


### `yarn add` // `npm i`

To install al dependencies


### `yarn server` // `npm run server`

Runs the json-server in the development mode.\
Endpoint: [http://localhost:5000/posts](http://localhost:5000/posts)

I set this so to be as close as posible to a real environment in which the JSON comes from the backend

### `yarn start` // `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
